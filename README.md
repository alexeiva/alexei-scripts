### Alexei's scripts for Glyphs App for G2

---

#### Metrics: 

* **Set Kerning Groups for GF Latin Plus**
→ Derived from @schriftgestalt's [set Kerning Groups][1]. Kerning class declarations have been fully reworked to support [GF Latin Plus][2] and [GF Cyrillic Plus][6] Glyphs Sets. 
 
* **Fix Vertical Metrics**
→ Creates custom parameters in all masters for vertical metrics according to the 125% rule. 

* **Update WinMetrics**
→ Updates `winAscent` and `winDescent` values. Useful for mastering fonts after adding tall glyphs such as Vietnamese. 

* **Inherit Kerning Groups**
→ Inherits Kerning Group to suffixed glyphs (.ssXX) from parent

* **Inherit Metrics Keys**
→ Inherits Metrics Keys to suffixed glyphs (.ssXX) from parent

* **Set Metrics Keys Auto**
→ Sets default Metrics Keys. Derived from `Set Kerning Groups` by @shriftgestalt

* **Steal Metrics Keys**
→ Copies Metrics Keys from other font. Stolen from `Steal kerning groups from font` by @mekkablue

* **Gridster**
→ Opens a new tab with Latin and Cyrillic grid tests.

 
#### Paths: 

* **Slant Rounds**
→ Slants round glyphs with vertical compensation. Based on method by Jacques Le Bailly @fonthausen. Need to specify Italic angle in font master. Use selectively on round glyphs `o c e`, etc,

#### Custom GlyphsData.xml
[GlyphsDataCYR.xml][5] should be placed inside an `Info` folder in the same directory as your .glyphs file:

```
Font Project
|-- Source.glyphs
|-- Info
	|-- GlyphsDataCYR.xml
```
